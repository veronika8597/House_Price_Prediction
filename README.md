# House price prediction - Data science project

### Have you ever wondered, what are the features that affect the house's price?
### Well,there you have it ;)


### Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the prices of houses based on various features such as location, size, number of       bedrooms, and other relevant factors. The project seeks to provide accurate price estimates to assist individuals, real estate agents, and investors in making informed decisions.

### Data Sources
The project relies on a comprehensive dataset that includes information about various houses, including their attributes and corresponding sale prices. The data can be obtained from reputable sources such as real estate agencies, property listings, or public datasets provided by government agencies. It is essential to ensure that the data is reliable, up-to-date, and contains sufficient features for accurate price prediction.
The "Realtor" website was used in this project.

### Methodologies
The project involves the following key methodologies:

#### 1. Data Preprocessing: 
This step involves cleaning and transforming the raw data into a suitable format for analysis. It includes handling missing values, outlier detection, data normalization, and feature engineering.

#### 2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA helps to gain insights into the data and understand the relationships between different features. It involves visualizations, statistical summaries, and correlation analysis.

#### 3.Feature Selection and Engineering: 
Based on the insights gained from EDA, relevant features are selected or engineered to improve the predictive performance of the model. Techniques such as dimensionality reduction, one-hot encoding, and feature scaling may be employed.

#### 4.Model Development:
Various machine learning algorithms are explored and trained using the preprocessed data. The choice of algorithms include linear regression,Lasso and Bayesian Ridge. The models are evaluated using appropriate metrics and tuned for optimal performance.

#### 5.Model Evaluation: 
The trained models are evaluated using evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared. Cross-validation techniques and train-test splits are employed to assess the generalization performance of the models.

#### 6.Deployment: 
Once a satisfactory model was developed, it was deployed in a production environment. The model was shown in the Jupiter Notbook for real-time predictions of the assets. 

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, the House Price Prediction Data Science project aimed to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts house prices based on various features. Three regression models, namely Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Bayesian Ridge Regression, were trained and evaluated after preprocessing the data. The model with the best price prediction results was selected for further deployment. By leveraging the power of data science and machine learning, this project provides valuable insights and tools to assist individuals, real estate agents, and investors in making informed decisions in the dynamic housing market.
